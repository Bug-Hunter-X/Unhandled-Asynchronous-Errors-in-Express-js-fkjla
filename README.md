# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where asynchronous operations within request handlers are not handled correctly, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior. The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.

## Problem

In the `bug.js` file, an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation()`) is performed within a request handler.  If this operation throws an error, it's not caught within the handler, potentially causing the Express.js server to crash without providing a proper response to the client. The `console.error` is not sufficient to handle the error in the context of an Express.js application.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file corrects this by explicitly catching the error using `.catch()` and sending an appropriate error response to the client.  This ensures that the server remains stable and provides informative feedback to users.
